fork and modifications of [@halcy's](https://icosahedron.website/@halcy/114162499329644711) [fun little Mastodon-as-FUSE filesystem demo](https://gist.github.com/halcy/b4f455ef05c4c36906107e9367b8dd63).

I may have gone a bit too far
- requirements/pyproject to make it usable quickly
- cached media handling (but in memory, so: danger!)
- filesystem metadata
- notifications path
- various other poor choices

probably, don't use this.
